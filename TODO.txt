High priority
	internationalize strings
	refactor paypal stuff out of transacount id look so that it can be modular like camptix itself
	currency too
	assign all classes to global variables so they can be accessed by other plugins
	automatically grab credentials from individual site options, instead of having to assign via filter callback?

Medium priority
	add ability to send any 'critical' errors to array of admins
	add error notice if camptix isn't activated?
	log list table::prepare_items()
		probably need to refactor how $advanced_query_value[x] works if add other cases with different number of substitutions.
		since prepare() can take an array of args, maybe do an array_merge() of common arguments and an variable-length array of advanced query arguments
		or just prepare() it here, and cat it with $where below after $where runs through prepare()
		also, maybe avoid doing the regular query if doing an advanced query
	add note to network log search results to scroll down to see the highlighted entry. otherwise they might not realize it's there b/c it's below the fold.

Low priority
	fire gather_events_data job whenever new site is added to network, or when camptix activated?
	add link to dashboard from camptix proper to help let people know about it?
	camptix_log_email_notifications()
		Maybe send batch of notifications via a cron job, instead of immediatetly sending an e-mail for each match
		If current approach proves to be too expensive during traffic spikes (like when ticket sales open for a big event), we could setup a cron job to run every 10 minutes and scan new entries since it last ran.
	setup $table_name as class var instead of multiple times in diff functions so the logic is DRY
		set as public var so other classes can use it
	gather_events_data()
		store time in utc, but display in current site's timezone
		put filter around 1000 limit. there are a few others places that need this too
		being stored in redundantly individual tables rather than in global table
	network log search for something like "id:refund" should probably return 0 results
