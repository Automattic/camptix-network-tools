== Installation ==

***Note: In order for this plugin to work, you must have a [WordPress Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite) installation already setup, and have a Super Admin account.***

1. Download and extract CampTix Network Tools in your `wp-content/plugins` directory, or search for it in the Plugins page in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the CampTix Network Dashboard located? =
The dashboard is located under the Dashboard menu in the Network Admin area (e.g., http://example.org/wp-admin/network/).

= Why don't my sites show up in the Overview tab? =
The data on the Overview tab is only generated once every hour. You can tell when it was last generated by looking at the bottom of the page.

= Why do I get error on the Transactions tab saying credentials weren't found? =

In order to lookup transaction details, CampTix Network Tools needs to know what payment gateway to use, and what your credentials are for it.

You can specify them by setting up a filter callback like the example below. The best place to put the code is inside a [functionality plugin](http://www.doitwithwp.com/create-functions-plugin/).

Currently, transaction lookups are only available with PayPal.

`function camptix_dashboard_paypal_credentials( $credentials ) {
	$credentials = array(
		"sandbox-account" => array(
			'label'         => "Sandbox Account",
			'sandbox'       => true,
			'api_username'  => '',
			'api_password'  => '',
			'api_signature' => '',
		),
		"production-account" => array(
			'label'         => 'Production Account',
			'sandbox'       => false,
			'api_username'  => '',
			'api_password'  => '',
			'api_signature' => '',
		),
	);
	return $credentials;
}
add_filter( 'camptix_dashboard_paypal_credentials', 'camptix_dashboard_paypal_credentials' );`

= How do I get e-mail notifications when log events occur? =
You can use the `camptix_nt_notification_expressions` filter to add custom notifications. For each entry, you'll provide a regular expression that matches a log entry, and an array of e-mail addresses that will be notified whenever a match occurs. The best place to put the code is inside a [functionality plugin](http://www.doitwithwp.com/create-functions-plugin/).

Here's an example of several different patterns being matched and associated with e-mail addresses:

`function camptix_email_notification_expressions( $expressions ) {
	$expressions = array_merge( $expressions, array(
		'/changed to (failed|pending|refund)/'     => array( 'jane@example.org', 'admin@example.net' ),
		'/Error during RefundTransaction/i'        => array( 'admin@example.net' ),
		'/Setting all transactions to refund/i'    => array( 'jane@example.org' ),
		'/Warning during PayPal request/i'         => array( 'admin@example.net', 'jane@example.org' ),
	) );

	return $expressions;
}
add_filter( 'camptix_nt_notification_expressions', 'camptix_email_notification_expressions' );`
